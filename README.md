# Eye Magnification Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and analyze eye magnification in real-time video streams. It calculates pupil size based on facial landmarks and determines screen visibility comfort levels. The implementation aims to provide accurate results across varying lighting conditions.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Analyzes video streams for eye magnification.
- **Accurate Pupil Size Calculation:** Uses facial landmarks to estimate pupil size.
- **Screen Visibility Comfort:** Evaluates screen visibility based on magnification levels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mukilan1/Eye-Magnification-Detection.git
   cd eye-magnification-detection
